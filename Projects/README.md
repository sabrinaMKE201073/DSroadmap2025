# 🛠️ Projects

This folder contains mini projects and notebooks that demonstrate my practical skills in data analysis, data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Each project is based on real-world datasets and uses Python tools like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and SQL.

> 📌 These projects are part of my learning journey in the DataCamp Associate Data Scientist track and preparation for job readiness.
