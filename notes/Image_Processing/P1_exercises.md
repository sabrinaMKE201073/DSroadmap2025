### Exercise 1: Flipping out

<img src="e11.JPG" width="300">

```python
# Flip the image vertically
seville_vertical_flip = np.flipud(flipped_seville)

# Flip the image horizontally
seville_horizontal_flip = np.fliplr(seville_vertical_flip)

# Show the resulting image
show_image(seville_horizontal_flip, 'Seville')
```

### Exercise 2: Histograms

<img src="e22.JPG" width="300">

```python
# Obtain the red channel
red_channel = image[:, :, 0]

# Plot the red histogram with bins in a range of 256
plt.hist(red_channel.ravel(), bins=256)

# Set title and show
plt.title('Red Histogram')
plt.show()
```
<p align="center">
  <img src="e21.JPG" width="400">
</p>

ðŸ“ŒWith this histogram we see that the image is quite reddish, meaning it has a sensation of warmness. This is because it has a wide and large distribution of bright red pixels, from 0 to around 150.

### Exercise 3: Apply global thresholding

<img src="e31.JPG" width="300">

```python
# Import the otsu threshold function
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu

# Make the image grayscale using rgb2gray
chess_pieces_image_gray = rgb2gray(chess_pieces_image)

# Obtain the optimal threshold value with otsu
thresh = threshold_otsu(chess_pieces_image_gray)

# Apply thresholding to the image
binary = chess_pieces_image_gray > thresh

# Show the image
show_image(binary, 'Binary image')
```

### Exercise 4: Apply uneven background illumination for better result\

<img src="e41.JPG" width="300">

```python
global_thresh = threshold_otsu(page_image)

# Obtain the binary image by applying global thresholding
binary_global = page_image > global_thresh

# Show the binary image obtained
show_image(binary_global, 'Global thresholding')
```
<p align="center">
  <img src="e42.JPG" width="400">
</p>

ðŸ“Œif using the global threshold, some of the formula is unclear after thresholded.

```python
# Import the local threshold function
from skimage.filters import threshold_local

# Set the block size to 35
block_size = 35

# Obtain the optimal local thresholding
local_thresh = threshold_local(page_image, block_size, offset=10)

# Obtain the binary image by applying local thresholding
binary_local = page_image > local_thresh

# Show the binary image
show_image(binary_local, 'Local thresholding')
```
<p align="right">
  <img src="e43.JPG" width="400">
</p>

ðŸ“Œ Much better version using Local threshold for this kind of image, if the image has a wide variation of background intensity.
