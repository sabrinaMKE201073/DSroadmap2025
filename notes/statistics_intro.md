## ðŸ“– Key Concepts

### âœ… Concept 1: Summary Statistics

#### ðŸ”¹ 1. Variance
- Measures how spread out the data points are from the mean.
- **Function**: `np.var()`

```python
import numpy as np
np.var (msleep['sleep_total'], ddof=1)
```

Without ddof=1, population variance is calculated instead of sample variance.

3) Standard deviation

- using np.std()
