## ðŸ“– Key Concepts

### âœ… Concept 1: Summary Statistics

#### ðŸ”¹ 1. Variance
- Measures how spread out the data points are from the mean.
- **Function**: `np.var()`

```python
import numpy as np

data = [10, 12, 23, 23, 16, 23, 21, 16]
variance = np.var(data)
print("Variance:", variance)
```

3) Standard deviation

- using np.std()
