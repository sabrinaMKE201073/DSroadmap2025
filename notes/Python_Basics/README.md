# 🐍 Python Basics

This folder contains my practice notebooks and scripts as I learn Python through [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) and run my code on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## 📚 Contents

- `.ipynb` notebooks: Exercises and notes from interactive practice on Google Colab.
- `.py` scripts: Cleaned or reusable versions of code, where applicable.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

These files cover fundamental Python topics, including:

- Variables and data types  
- Conditionals and loops  
- Functions and scope  
- Lists, dictionaries, and other data structures  
- Basic error handling and logic

## 🚀 Tools Used

- **Google Colab** – for running and testing code interactively  
- **Python 3** – main programming language  
- **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)** – for note-taking and exploratory code  
- **VS Code or text editor** – for writing `.py` scripts
